# India-bank-credit-analytics-dashboard
This project is part of my learning journey from core finance operations and credit control into business analytics and project management. By working with real India-focused banking data, building an Excel dashboard, and leveraging AI tools like Brisk AI for insight generation, I am strengthening my ability to translate raw financial data into clear, actionable stories for decision-makers. This combination of domain knowledge, analytics, and AI adoption is central to my long-term career path in finance and analytics leadership.
